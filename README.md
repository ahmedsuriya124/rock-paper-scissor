This is a simple Rock Paper Scissors game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows players to choose between rock, paper, or scissors and play against the computer. The computer's choice is generated randomly, and the game logic determines the winner based on the rules of the classic game. The user interface is interactive, with a clean design, and the game provides instant feedback on who won each round.

**Features:**
1. Interactive user interface with simple buttons for choosing rock, paper, or scissors
2. Random computer choice generation
3. Display of game results (win, loss, or draw)
4. Score tracking for multiple rounds
5. Responsive design for compatibility across devices
